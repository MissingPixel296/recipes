    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      There's nothing like a refreshing glass of ice cold lemonade to cool you
      down on a hot day. Just make sure to add the ice right before serving —
      you don't want it to dilute the sweet flavor.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>9 medium lemons, or more as needed</li>
      <li>7 cups ice-cold water</li>
      <li>Ice as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Stir to dissolve
        sugar while mixture comes to a boil. Set aside to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, roll lemons around on your counter to soften. Cut in half
        crosswise, and squeeze into a liquid measuring cup. Add pulp to the
        juice, but discard any seeds. Continue juicing until you have 1 1/2 cups
        fresh juice and pulp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 7 cups ice-cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp,
        then add simple syrup to taste. Add ice.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
