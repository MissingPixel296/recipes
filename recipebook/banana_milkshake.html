    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Bananas can have a one-note flavor, but this banana milkshake has a few
      things to heighten the flavor and make it irresistible. A small amount of
      lemon juice wakes up the banana flavor, followed by a dash of vanilla and
      small dusting of cinnamon. When everything is combined, it just tastes
      like the best banana milkshake ever, but the flavor lingers because of the
      additions.
